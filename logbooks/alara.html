      <h2>Week of January 1, 2025</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>January was relatively quiet due to the semester break. Most team members had returned to their hometowns, and we couldn’t maintain our regular meetings or collaborative momentum. The general exhaustion from the fall semester was noticeable, and everyone took some time to rest and focus on individual tasks. During this period, I continued to monitor and refine the frontend, ensuring everything remained functional and up-to-date. I also revisited our dataset to validate its completeness and structure. Despite our initial plan to begin modeling this month, we fell slightly behind schedule due to the lack of group coordination. Although progress was slower than expected, this downtime also gave us a chance to recharge. We expect February to be a more productive month as the team regroups with renewed motivation.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Week of February 1, 2025</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We resumed active project work at the beginning of the new semester. The team reconvened and started realigning with our original timeline. I shifted my full focus to working with our dataset. Since the frontend was already near completion by the end of the previous term, I did not make any new changes to it.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Week of February 8, 2025</h2>
      <ul>

      <ul>
        <li>With the dataset finalized, I began preparing the environment to train our first predictive model. I experimented with different configurations and preprocessing pipelines. There were minor challenges with aligning structured data inputs, but they were resolved with a few adjustments.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Week of February 22, 2025</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I successfully ran our initial model on the refined dataset. This was a critical milestone, as we could finally start evaluating prediction performance. Our meeting this week centered on model results and deciding how to improve accuracy. I began drafting a plan for tuning and comparing models in March.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Week of March 1, 2025</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Following February’s initial modeling phase, we began analyzing our model’s performance. Unfortunately, the prediction error was higher than expected. During this week’s meeting, we decided to prioritize parameter optimization and model tuning. I began working with LSTM and GRU architectures to assess their ability to better capture temporal patterns in financial data.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Week of March 8, 2025</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>My focus this week was experimenting with different configurations of LSTM networks, including layer depth and sequence length. In parallel, Emre worked on regression-based models such as Random Forest and a heuristic-based method. Our team explored how different algorithms might complement each other or be used in an ensemble.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Week of March 15, 2025</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I shifted to tuning GRU models and began comparing their performance with LSTMs using validation datasets. I also evaluated the impact of different activation functions and optimizers. Emre shared results from Random Forest and heuristic models, and we discussed merging insights for improved interpretability.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Week of March 22, 2025</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>By the end of the month, I had a clearer understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of LSTM vs. GRU in our context. We documented each model’s metrics and began thinking about presenting these findings in our final report. Our Wednesday meeting focused on refining model evaluation criteria and setting priorities for April.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Week of April 1, 2025</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>At the start of April, we decided to focus on the Random Forest model, which had shown the most promising performance among all the models tested so far. Emre and I worked closely to improve its predictive accuracy. Meanwhile, other team members concentrated on polishing the frontend and completing the backend infrastructure.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Week of April 8, 2025</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To enhance our model’s input quality, I began collecting 8-K reports—press releases filed by companies that often contain timely, high-impact financial information. Compared to quarterly reports, these were far more numerous. Gathering and organizing them took nearly a full week, as I had to handle large volumes and ensure consistency.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Week of April 15, 2025</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>After completing the 8-K collection, I manually reviewed their contents and assigned sentiment-based scores to each document. These scores were designed to quantify the tone and potential financial implications of each report. I then carefully integrated these new features into our main dataset, aligning them by company and reporting date.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Week of April 22, 2025</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>With the enriched dataset, I retrained the Random Forest model. The new input features significantly improved our model’s performance, as reflected in a notable decrease in Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Our Wednesday meeting focused on reviewing these results and planning how to present the impact of 8-K integration in our final evaluation.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
